# Aloha Website

This is the first project I do as part of my Web Development course at the Red Academy. 

It's a simple static website that uses HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. 

The carousel on the products section uses the Flickity plugin (https://flickity.metafizzy.co/) and the smooth scrolling is created with code from css-tricks (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/)
