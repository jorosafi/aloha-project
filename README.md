# Aloha Website

Hello world! This my very first website built from scratch. 

It's the first project I do as part of my Web Development course at the Red Academy.

It is a static responsive website that uses simple HTML, CSS and Javascript to build the home page of a mock shopping site called Aloha. 

In this project I practiced many responsive web design techniques. I learned to used flexbox to layout the content of the website and used media queries to make create break points at 600px and 1240px. 

To load the fonts on any computer, I used the website Transfonter.org to convert the fonts into different formats and I linked a separate css (fonts.css) that contains all the font faces for the website. 

The website also has some basic functionality that uses Javascript and JQuery. The smooth scrolling was created using code from css-tricks(https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/), white the carousel on the products section uses the Flickity plugin (https://flickity.metafizzy.co/).

I also added some JQuery code to validate email addresses on the email updates form and to add the number of items in the cart when users click on the add-to-cart buttons.
