# Aloha Website

This is the first project I do as part of my Web Development course at the Red Academy, and the first website I build from scratch. 

This is a static responsive website that uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

In this project I practiced many responsive web design techniques. I used flexbox to keep layout elements responsive as the screen size changes, and media queries to make layout changes at two break points, 600px and 1240px. 

To load the fonts on any computer, I used the website Transfonter.org to convert the fonts into different formats and I linked a separate css (fonts.css) that contains all the font faces for the website. 

The website has some basic functionality achieved using Javascript and JQuery. The smooth scrolling was created using code from css-tricks(https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/). The carousel on the products section uses the Flickity plugin (https://flickity.metafizzy.co/).

I also added some JQuery code to validate email addresses on the email updates form and to add the number of items in the cart when users click on the add-to-cart.
